<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Myat, a techie who's passionate about all things tech and designs. My love for technology and design started from my very first class of Graphic Design 1 in my freshmen year of high school and it just never stopped.ðŸ¤“ <br>
I now leverage my background in Information Systems Management along with Customer Service to help create user-friendly and inclusive UI designs.<br>
When I'm not working, you can find me spending time at a coffee shop reading, drawing, coding or strolling around museums with my camera. I also like to learn new things every now and then ; right now I'm learning how to skate board.</p>
